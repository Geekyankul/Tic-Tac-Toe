# Tic-Tac-Toe

### OBJECTIVE:
This project aims to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using Javascript. It mainly consists of developing and implementing a computer program that plays Tic Tac Toe against another player.<br/>

### GAME DESCRIPTION:
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game (one of them being played by computer or human). In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.<br/>

### GAME RULES:
1.	The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (player 2).
2.	Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.
3.	A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:<br/>
a.	One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.<br/>
b.	If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a  draw/tie.
